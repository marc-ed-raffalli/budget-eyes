It also compares the current period (current month or week) against the selected time range.
The default selected time range is 3 months, but it can be changed using the calendar icon on the top right corner.

#### Expenses grouped by period

This line chart shows the sum of all the expenses grouped by period (monthly / weekly) during the selected time range.

#### Budget total by period

This line chart shows the total amount spent per budget for each period (month / week) during the selected time range.

#### Budget current status and trend over period

This bar chart shows the amount spent per budget in the current period (current month or week). 
It is compared to the amount planned and the average spent on the same budget during the selected time range.

#### Expenses grouped by tag

This radar chart shows the current total of the expenses during the current period (current month or week) compared to the average of expenses during the selected time range. 
The chart requires three distinct tags to be matched in the expenses in order to be rendered.

Zero values are ignored.
