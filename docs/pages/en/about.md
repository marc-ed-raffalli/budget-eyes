# About

Budget-eyes is the fruit of many hours of work done during my spare time.
The original idea started few years back but carried on between stages of evolution, pause, concept refinement, implementation, review and test to finally arrive to the current version.
Despite the fact the implementation was paused many times, as well as the fact that the market offers many similar applications nowadays.
It is both a strong will to release the App to the public and the support of the people surrounding me which pushed me to pursue the project.    

Through this project, I could discover and get familiar with various very interesting technologies / frameworks, from the development to the testing phase.
A big thanks to the developers of:

- [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/)
- [Angular Chart](https://jtblin.github.io/angular-chart.js/) / [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/)
