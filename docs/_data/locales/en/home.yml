  - header:   Intuitive and customizable
    content:
      - Budget Eyes uses an intuitive concept of "tags" and "budgets" which you create and customize.
      - The "tags" describe what was each expense is about e.g. snack, metro, ...
      - The "budgets" allow you to keep an eye on a group of tags relating to a specific area e.g. a "Transports" budget to keep track of what is spent on "bus", "metro", "taxi".
